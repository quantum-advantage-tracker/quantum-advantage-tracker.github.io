# `peaked_circuit`

Peaked Circuits are constructed to produce distributions that are peaked on a hidden bitstring (i.e. there is a bitstring that has orders of magnitude higher probability to be sampled than any other bitstring).

The construction method is detailed here: [Heuristic Quantum Advantage with Peaked Circuits ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25838).

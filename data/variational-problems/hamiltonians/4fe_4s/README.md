# `4fe_4s`

[4Fe–4S] cluster as considered in [_Low-energy spectrum of iron–sulfur clusters directly from many-particle quantum mechanics_](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2041).

The active spaces are obtained from [_Spin-Projected Matrix Product States: Versatile Tool for Strongly Correlated Systems_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00270), which are spanned by Fe[3d] and S[3p] orbitals, derived from a localized Density Functional Theory calculation with BP86 functional, is a TZP-DKH basis, and sf-X2C (spin-free exact two-component) Hamiltonian to include scalar relativistic effects.

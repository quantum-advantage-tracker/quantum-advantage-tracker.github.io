# `four_impurity_model`

Circuits representing different Trotter steps corresponding to Krylov states, as discussed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09702

There are two circuit types:

1. in the basis where bath is diagonal
2. SKQD natural orbitals

(for more details, please see https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09702)

## Adding a new circuit instance

Each circuit instance must have its own folder named after its unique identifier. Inside this folder, include a `README.md` file containing the following information: **Description**, **QASM file**, and **Institutions**.

You can use the provided [template](../../_circuit_instance_template/README.md) as a guide for creating the `README.md`.

The folder should also include the corresponding **QASM file** itself.

## Description

The aim of this experiment is to compute the Operator Loschmidt Echo (OLE):

$$f_\delta (O) = \frac{1}{2^n} \text{Tr}\left(U O U^\dagger  V_\delta^\dagger UOU^\dagger V_\delta \right),$$

where $O$ is an observable such that $\text{Tr}(O^2) = 1$, $U$ is an unitary, and $V_\delta = e^{-i \delta G}$ is a perturbation generated by $G$.

In the limit of small $\delta$, the OLE is proportional to the out-of-time-order correlator between $O$ and $G$ and can be used to probe the operator dynamics under the unitary $U$:

$$f_\delta(O) \approx 1 - \frac{\delta^2}{2}\frac{1}{2^n}\text{Tr}\left(\left[G, U^\dagger O U\right]\left[G, U^\dagger O U\right]^\dagger\right).$$

For more details on the OLE and its applications, please check out [Algorithmiq's model description and theory](https://algorithmiq.fi/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/model-information-flow-complex-material-document.pdf).

To compute the OLE of an observable $O \in \{I,Z\}^{\otimes n}$, where $Z$ is the Pauli-Z matrix and $n$ is the number of qubits, we use the identity

$$f_\delta(O) = \frac{1}{2^{n}} \sum_z \sigma_z \underbrace{\bra{z} U^\dagger V_\delta^\dagger U O U^\dagger V_\delta \ket{z}}_{\equiv f_\delta^z(O)},$$

where the sum is over all $2^n$ computational basis state $\ket{z}$ and $\sigma_z \equiv \bra{z}O\ket{z}\in\{\pm 1\}$ is the parity of $\ket{z}$ with respect to $O$ and can be trivially computed.

Since $f_\delta^z(O)$ is bounded, instead of iterating over all computational basis states, we can estimate $f_\delta (O)$ from $N_{\text{init}}$ initial states $z$ uniformly drawn at random:

$$f_\delta(O) \approx \frac{1}{N_{\text{init}}} \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{init}}} f_\delta^{z_i}(O).$$

The standard deviation of this estimate decreases with $N_{\text{init}}$ as $O\left(1/\sqrt{N_{\text{init}}}\right)$.

In this experiment, we consider a lattice $\Lambda$, e.g. a heavy-hex or a square lattice, and the unitary $U$ constructed from the Trotterized time evolution of an Ising-like Hamiltonian (Please check out [Algorithmiq's model description and theory](https://algorithmiq.fi/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/model-information-flow-complex-material-document.pdf) for details and applications):

$$U = (U_{-b}^\dagger)^L U_b^L,$$

where $2L$ is the number of Trotter steps,

$$U_b = \prod_{E \in {\cal E}} \prod_{(u,v) \in E} e^{-i \frac{\pi}{4} Z_u Z_v} e^{-i \frac{\pi}{8} (Z_u + Z_v)} e^{-i (b_u X_u + b_v X_v)},$$

$X_u, Z_u$ are the Pauli operators on site $u\in\Lambda$, $E\in \mathcal E$ are sets of edges such that edges in the same set are nonoverlapping, and $b_u$ are site-dependent angles. In particular, we partition the sites in $\Lambda$ into two complementary sets $F$ and $S$ and choose $b_u = 3\pi/8$ if $u\in F$ and $b_u = b$ otherwise. Note that in our convention, rotations from the set $E_i$ are applied before those from $E_j$ for all $i<j$. The perturbation $V_\delta$ is generated by

$$G = \sum_{u\in \mathcal P} X_i,$$

where $\mathcal P \subset \Lambda$ is a set of sites on the lattice.
